# Project "Suits"

## Introduction

### Project Overview
Pearson Specter is transitioning from paper-based documentation to an efficient electronic system. This proposal outlines the scope, objectives, recommendations, and outcomes for developing a web-based platform to meet the firm's needs.

### Problem Statement
Employees currently have to call assistants or go to the copy room whenever they need a document. A centralized system where they can upload and access documents as needed would solve this inefficiency.

## Scope and Objectives

### Scope
Project "Suits" aims to create a centralized platform for all Pearson Specter employees with Role-Based Access Control for streamlined access to essential documents.

### Objectives
- Design and implement a user-friendly website interface
- Integrate Role-Based Access Control for secure document access  
- Develop a robust backend for document management and storage
- Provide comprehensive training and support for effective platform utilization

## Project Description

### System Overview
- A website where employees can sign in with unique credentials
- Access documents based on job roles and position 
- Role-Based Access Control technology for security and integrity
- Upload, search, edit, and delete legal documents (agreements, case files, contracts, evidence, etc.)

### Business Benefits
- Increased productivity from reduced document search time
- Enhanced data security through restricted access
- Streamlined document management with centralized storage  
- Competitive advantage by demonstrating technological innovation

### Deliverables
- Functional website with intuitive user interface
- Integrated Role-Based Access Control system
- Backend infrastructure for document management and storage
- User documentation and training materials
- Ongoing support and maintenance plan

## Estimated Timeline 
- Project duration: 4 months (May 2024 - August 2024)
- Follows Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) phases

## System Description 

### Alternatives Considered.
Off-the-shelf software and custom development were evaluated. A web-based application was chosen for seamless functionality, scalability, and reliability.

### System Functionality
- Web-based application accessible across devices
- Login environment with user credentials
- Document upload with metadata (type, client, case number)
- Document access based on user rights (edit, delete)
- Searchable repository using keywords, type, client name

### Expected Outcomes
- Organized, searchable document repository 
- User-friendly and easy to navigate
- Secure storage of documents and personal information

## Feasibility Assessment

### Economic Feasibility
- Cost-benefit analysis of expenses (development, maintenance, overhead) 
- Return on investment calculation (cost savings, revenue, user satisfaction)

### Technical Feasibility
- New IT infrastructure, hardware, and software installation
- Ensure proper database integration and technology assessment
- Scalability and performance monitoring for future growth

### Legal and Contractual
No issues as the system will be developed in-house.

### Political and Operational
- Effective stakeholder communication for aligned goals
- User training and support for collaboration 
- User surveys for feedback and issue resolution
- Risk mitigation strategies for user errors and failures

### Schedule
- 4-month timeline with adequate resources
- Consideration of all factors (deployment, testing, training, adoption)

## Management

### Team Configuration
- Task responsibility matrix defined
- Communication plan with contact details established

### Client Involvement
- Periodic walkthroughs for system review and feedback
- Walkthrough review form and action list templates provided

### Project Planning 
- Gantt chart for schedule overview
